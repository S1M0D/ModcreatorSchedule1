## Schedule 1 Modding Tool

- Work-in-progress WPF editor inspired by MCreator for building Schedule One quest, NPC, and other S1API content.
- Generates feature classes (quests, npcs, saveables) that plug into a single `Core : MelonMod` entry referencing S1API.
- MVVM structure: `Models/`, `ViewModels/`, `Views/`; generator logic in `Services/`, helpers in `Utils/`, styles/icons in `Resources/`.
- Current status: active development; no public release yet. Progress tracking lives on the project Trello board [S1 Mod Creator](https://trello.com/b/D8wEoJsh/s1-mod-creator).
